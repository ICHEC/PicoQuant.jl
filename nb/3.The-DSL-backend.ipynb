    "## The DSL backend\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction tutorial, backends are responsible for keeping track of any tensors created/removed during the creation or contraction of tensor networks. The DSL backend does this by writing tensor data, and commands describing the manipulation of it, to disk instead of saving the data in memory and acting on it interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a DSL backend, when a tensor network is created with PicoQuant, all of the associated tensor data will be written to a HDF5 file. When we call functions to contract or manipulate tensors contained in a tensor network, instead of acting on the tensor data in the HDF5 file directly, the DSL backend will use a domain specfic language to write commands describing the contraction/manipulation. These commands are written to a DSL script which is created when the DSL backend is created. Therefore, for example, contracting a tensor network representing a quantum circuit with a DSL backend will not produce the output of the circuit immediately. To get the output, we must also call an execute_dsl_file function which will read the DSL commands in the DSL script and then perform the operations described there to produce the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of writing a DSL script over operating on tensor data interactively is that it allows for a preprocessing stage, before any tensor operations are carried out with the tensor data, where an efficient execution of the DSL commands can be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before illustrating the behaviour of PicoQuant functions induced by the DSL backend, we give a brief description of the domain specfic language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Domain Specific Language\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain specific language consists of the following commands:\n",
    "1. tensor - Command to load a tensor from the HDF5 file referenced by the DSL backend. Input arguments are: \n",
    "    1. A name for a variable to bind to the tensor data when it is loaded into memory \n",
    "    2. The name under which the tensor data is saved in the HDF5 file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. del - Command to delete a tensor. Input arguments are:\n",
    "    1. The vaiable name of a tensor in memory to delete\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. save - Command to save a tensor to a given output file. Input arguments are:\n",
    "    1. The tensor variable name, \n",
    "    2. The output HDF5 file name,\n",
    "    3. The name to save the tensor under within the HDF5 file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ncon - Command to contract two tensors $A$ and $B$ together and produce a new tensor $C$. Input arguments are \n",
    "    1. A name for the new tensor $C$, \n",
    "    2. The name for the first tensor $A$ \n",
    "    3. The ncon indices identifying which indices of $A$ to contract, \n",
    "    4. The name of the second tensor $B$,\n",
    "    5. The ncon indices for the second tensor $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. reshape - Command to reshape a tensor. Input arguments are:\n",
    "    1. The name of a tensor to reshape,\n",
    "    2. An array of integers specifying the desired shape of the tensor.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. decompose - Command to decompose a tensor using SVD. Input arguments are:\n",
    "    1. The name of the tensor to decompose,\n",
    "    2. An array of integers iddentifying the indices of the tensor to be considered the left indices during SVD.\n",
    "    3. An array of integers iddentifying the right indices of the tensor during SVD.\n",
    "    4. A real, positive number giving the threshold under which singular values will be discarded."
