## OpenQASM_Generator.ipynb
This notebook is a simple implementation of OpenQASM generator
functions in Julia (v1.0). Most of the majority operations are defined
relative to the U(theta,phi, lambda) syntax.

An example implementation of a QFT / IQFT generation script is given 
at the end.

TODO:

- Extend above into Julia module, and add more examples to generate.
- Add verification tests using Qiskit to examine validity of generated code
