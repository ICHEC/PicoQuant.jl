    "In this notebook we provide some details about how tensor networks are stored in PicoQuant. The data structure that PicoQuant uses to represent a quantum circuit as a tensor network consists of three julia structs: \n",
    "1. A Node struct representing a tensor in the tensor network.\n",
    "2. An Edge struct reprsenting an edge in the tensor network graph.\n",
    "3. A TensorNetworkCircuit struct holding references to all the nodes and edges in the tensor network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first create a tensor network for a quantum circuit and then briefly describe and illustrate the composition/use of these structs."

    "The TensorNetworkCircuit struct plays the role of a parent struct for the nodes and edges in a network. Namely, it holds references to all the Node and Edge instances representing a particular tensor network. This makes it convenient to access and manipulate nodes/edges. The fields of the TensorNetworkCircuit structure as listed below:\n",

    "\n",

The pair are save in the mentioned dictionary with the unique label as the key and the struct as the value.\n",

    "The main purpose of the Node struct is to hold an array of index labels (saved as julia symbols) corresponding to the indices of the tensor the node represents. These index labels are used to determine how tensors should be reshaped, permuted and contracted whenever the tensor network is altered. The fields of the node struct are:\n",
    "\n",

    "Note, tensor data is not stored in the Node struct or in the TensorNetworkCircuit struct. Instead, tensor data is stored by the backend the user initialises PicoQuant with before any tensors are created. When the user adds a gate to the network, a symbol is created as a label for the gate data. Then both the label and tensor data are passed to the backend for storing. The TensorNetworkCircuit struct also saves the same label for the tensor data along with the corresponding Node struct in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we get the instance of Node corrsponding to the first tensor added to the network and show how we typically access the indices of a node. We can compare the printed indices with those displayed in the above graph of the tensor network and see that they match as expected."

When a node is added to the tensor network, an edge struct is created for each index of the node (if one doesn't already exist) and is stored with the corresponding index label in the edges dictionary mentioned at the beginning of this notebook. Each edge struct will be given two gate labels to store that identify the two nodes in the network which share the corrsponding index. If the index associated with an edge is an open index, then one of the gate labels in the edge struct is replaced with the constant 'nothing'.\n",
    "\n",
