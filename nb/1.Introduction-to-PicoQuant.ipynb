    "\n",
    "PicoQuant is a prototype of QuantEx: a platform consisting of modular quantum circuit simulation tools which use tensor network contractions methods. We use hierarchical layers of abstraction to encapsulate complexity and enable these tools to be easily extended and integrated into usersâ€™ circuit simulation codes. The layers are outlined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Layer 1 - Operations in this layer perform the actual computations that are coordinated by\n",
    "layer 2. This layer consists of a number of backends which are capable of\n",
    "performing the computations for a variety of different platforms and scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Layer 2 - Operations here are concerned with manipulating tensor network structures\n",
    "and are responsible for coordinating and passing off to layer 1 functions\n",
    "to perform the computations.\n",

    "- Layer 3 - This is the highest layer and deals with the conversion of circuit\n",

    "When creating a tensor network, we can choose to initialise a backend. By default, an InteractiveBackend is used. Backends are responsible for keeping track of any tensors created/removed during the creation and contraction of tensor networks. When the user calls a function that alters the structure of a tensor network, the function will use the given backend to invoke function methods that handle the tensor data in a way that is specific to that backend. We currently have two different backends that may be used:\n",

    "    - When a function is called to carry out an operation (contraction, reshape, decompose, permute etc...) on tensors in the tensor network, it is carried out immediately and the tensors are updated in realtime  \n",

    "    - This backend is initialised by passing a DSLBackend(\"dsl_file.tl\", \"tensor_file.h5\", \"output_file.h5\") to the TensorNetworkCircuit constructor.\n",
    "    - When tensors/gates are added to a tensor network, this backend will write the tensor data to the given hdf5 file for storing tensors. Tensors that are the result of contracting a network will be written to the given output file. By default, if no arguments are given to this constructor, both tensor and output data will be written to a file called \"tensor_data.h5\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Up until recently it has been possible to simulate the largest prototype universal quantum computers using direct evolution of the quantum state (where the full wave-function is stored in memory (or on disk)). This is a very computationally demanding problem owing to the exponential growth in the state space as the number of qubits is increased. With the recent emergence of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, it has become intractable to use this approach to simulate devices of this size on even the largest supercomputers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most promising alternative to direct evolution of the full wave-function are tensor network contraction methods. They work by representing quantum states and operators using networks of tensors where calculations correspond to contractions over network edges. Tensor network methods are also approximate methods, well approximating many qubit states with low entanglement. Thus, while a full wave function simulator is ideal for simulating quantum circuits with a small number of qubits, tools such as QuantEx will be most beneficial for simulating quantum circuits with low depth and high width. This is illustrated in the graphic below:\n",
