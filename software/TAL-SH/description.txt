(already used for the qFlex investigation)


- Other project where the code is used:
TAL-SH is a library used in qFlex (although with some improvements implemented in the latter).


- Details on how they are coded (language, parallelisation):
The library implements basic tensor algebra operations with interfaces to C, C++11, and Fortran 90+. It is suitable for nodes equipped with multicore CPU, Nvidia GPU, and Intel Xeon Phi.


- Performance / scaling results available:
